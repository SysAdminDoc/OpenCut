# OpenCut — Implementation Roadmap

**Version**: 3.0
**Updated**: 2026-04-13
**Baseline**: v1.9.26 (254 routes, 68 core modules, 17 blueprints, 867 tests)
**Feature Plan**: 302 features across 62 categories (see `features.md`)

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Never break what works** — Every wave ships a working product. No "rewrite everything then test."
2. **Incremental migration** — New code coexists with old. Feature flags gate rollout. Old paths removed only after new paths are proven.
3. **User-facing value first** — Each wave delivers visible improvements, not just internal refactors.
4. **Measure before optimizing** — Add telemetry/logging before assuming bottlenecks.
5. **Shared infrastructure first** — When multiple features need the same foundation (e.g., object tracking, spectral analysis), build the foundation once, then fan out.
6. **One new dependency per feature maximum** — Avoid dep explosion. Prefer extending existing deps (OpenCV, FFmpeg, Pillow) over adding new ones.

|--------|---------|
| **FFmpeg** | Pure FFmpeg filter — no Python deps beyond subprocess |
| **Pillow** | Image composition — already installed |
| **OpenCV** | Computer vision — already installed (`opencv-python-headless`) |
| **Existing AI** | Uses models already in the codebase (Whisper, Demucs, face detection, etc.) |
| **New dep** | Requires a new pip dependency |
| **New model** | Requires downloading a new AI model (potentially large) |
| **Pipeline** | Orchestrates existing modules — no new deps |

**Wave 2 Total: ~17 features, 0 new dependencies, ~20 new routes**

---

## Wave 3: Architecture & Infrastructure

**Goal**: Complete the remaining architectural work that enables heavy AI features in Waves 4-7. These are not user-facing but are prerequisites for scale.

**Timeline**: 6-10 weeks (runs in parallel with Waves 1-2)
**Dependencies**: Internal refactoring

### 3A — Process Isolation for GPU Workers (P0)

The single most important infrastructure change. Every AI feature in Waves 4-7 benefits from this.

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Worker pool architecture** | `opencut/workers/` with `WorkerManager`. Workers are separate Python processes per model family (whisper, demucs, realesrgan, depth, generation). |
| **IPC protocol** | Workers communicate via localhost HTTP (minimal Flask on random port) or `multiprocessing.Queue`. Job dispatcher routes by type. |
| **GPU memory management** | Worker reports VRAM on startup. Dispatcher checks available VRAM against model's known requirement before scheduling. Workers exit after 5-min idle to free VRAM. |
| **Graceful degradation** | GPU OOM → specific guidance ("Model needs 4GB VRAM, you have 2GB. Switching to CPU.") → optional CPU re-dispatch. |
| **Model registry** | `models.json` mapping model name → VRAM requirement, download size, expected load time. UI shows this info. |

**Deliverable**: No more OOM crashes from model conflicts. GPU utilization visible in status bar.

### 3B — UXP Full Parity & CEP Migration (P0)

CEP end-of-life is approximately September 2026. UXP must be production-ready before then.

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Shared component library** | `extension/shared/` with framework-agnostic components. Both CEP and UXP import from here. Build system outputs two bundles. |
| **Feature registry** | `features.json` defines every feature: id, label, endpoint, params schema, requires. Both panels auto-generate UI from this. Adding a feature = one JSON entry + one backend route. |
| **UXP feature gap closure** | Port remaining ~15% of CEP features to UXP. Mostly: workflow builder, full settings panel, plugin UI. |
| **Native UXP timeline access** | Replace ExtendScript `evalScript()` with direct `premierepro` UXP module for timeline read/write. 10x faster. |
| **Premiere menu integration** | Right-click → "OpenCut: Remove Silence" / "Add Captions" / "Normalize Audio" via UXP API. |
| **CEP deprecation plan** | Mark CEP panel as "legacy" in docs. Freeze CEP feature additions. All new features UXP-only after Wave 3. |

**Deliverable**: UXP panel at 100% parity. CEP can be removed when Adobe enforces it.

### 3C — FastAPI Migration (P3 — Deferred)

Low priority. Flask works fine at current scale. Migrate only if:
- Request validation boilerplate becomes unmanageable (>300 routes)
- WebSocket needs outgrow the current `websockets` library
- Auto-generated OpenAPI docs become essential for plugin developers

If triggered, migrate one blueprint at a time (system → settings → search → nlp → timeline → jobs → captions → audio → video). Pydantic models replace `safe_float()`/`safe_int()` hand-validation.

### 3D — TypeScript Migration (P3 — Incremental)

Continue incremental migration as files are touched. Priority order:
1. API layer (`src/api/types.ts` from OpenAPI schema)
2. Store/state management
3. Tab modules as they're refactored for new features

No dedicated sprint. Piggyback on feature work.

---

## Wave 4: New Feature Domains — Moderate Dependencies

**Goal**: Add new feature domains that require 1-2 new dependencies each but significantly expand OpenCut's capability.

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (after Wave 1, can overlap with Wave 3)
**New deps**: 4-6 new pip packages
**New routes**: ~30

### 4A — Privacy & Content Redaction (5 features)

| 56.2 | Spectral Repair / Frequency Removal | M | `librosa` (existing) | STFT → identify persistent spectral peaks (hum/buzz) → attenuate → inverse STFT. Auto-detect mode. |
| 56.1 | Visual Spectrogram Editor | L | `librosa` (existing) | FFmpeg `showspectrumpic` or librosa STFT → zoomable canvas in panel → brush tool mask → inverse STFT reconstruction. |

**New dependency**: None if using `onnxruntime` (already installed) for YAMNet. Otherwise `tflite-runtime` (lightweight).

### 4D — Proxy & Media Management (4 features)

| # | Feature | Effort | New Dep | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| 60.1 | Auto Proxy Generation | L | None | Detect clips >1080p → FFmpeg scale to target res + CRF 28 → store in `~/.opencut/proxies/` with manifest. Background job. |
| 60.2 | Proxy-to-Full-Res Swap on Export | S | None | Query timeline clip paths via ExtendScript → check against proxy manifest → verify originals exist → report. |

| 13.4 | LOG Camera Profile Pipeline | M | None (listed in 4B) | — |
| 43.1 | ACES Color Pipeline | L | None | ACES IDT/ODT via FFmpeg `colorspace` + `lut3d`. Bundled ACES LUTs (free from AMPAS). |

**New dependency**: None (FFmpeg + bundled LUT files).

**Wave 4 Total: ~18 features (excluding duplicates from Wave 1), 1-2 new deps, ~30 new routes**

---

## Wave 5: AI Dubbing & Voice Translation

**Goal**: Build the end-to-end AI dubbing pipeline — the single highest-value new AI capability. This is what ElevenLabs, HeyGen, and Rask.ai charge $50-100/month for.

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (after Wave 3A process isolation is ready)
**Prerequisite**: Wave 3A (GPU process isolation) — dubbing loads multiple large models sequentially
**New deps**: Minimal (leverages existing Chatterbox, Whisper, Demucs, SeamlessM4T)

| # | Feature | Effort | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 62.1 | End-to-End AI Dubbing Pipeline | XL | Transcribe → translate (SeamlessM4T) → voice-clone TTS (Chatterbox) with duration constraints → stem-separate original (Demucs, remove dialogue, keep music/SFX) → mix dubbed dialogue + original music/SFX → export. |
| 62.2 | Isochronous Translation | L | LLM-assisted translation constrained by segment duration. Iterate: translate → estimate TTS duration from syllable count → if too long, ask LLM to rephrase shorter → if too short, expand. Target +-10% of original. |
| 62.3 | Multi-Language Audio Track Management | M | FFmpeg `-map` to mux multiple audio streams with language metadata. Panel UI: track list with language dropdown, add/remove, default flag. Export multi-track MKV/MP4 or per-language files. |
| 62.4 | Emotion-Preserving Voice Translation | L | Extract prosody (F0 contour via librosa, RMS energy, speaking rate) from original → generate TTS with neutral prosody → transfer original prosody shape to dubbed audio via WORLD vocoder or pitch manipulation. |

**Workflow chain**: The dubbing pipeline calls 5 existing modules in sequence. The key new code is the orchestrator (`core/dubbing.py`) and the isochronous translation loop (`core/isochron_translate.py`).

**New dependency**: Potentially `pyworld` for vocoder-based prosody transfer (62.4). Everything else is already installed.

**Wave 5 Total: 4 features, 0-1 new deps, ~8 new routes**

---

## Wave 6: Advanced Professional Features

Wave 1 (Quick Wins)          |=============================|
Wave 2 (Pipelines)           |=======================|
Wave 3A (GPU Isolation)           |========================|
Wave 3B (UXP Parity)              |=====================|
Wave 4 (New Domains)                   |========================|
Wave 5 (AI Dubbing)                         |================|
Wave 6 (Pro Features)                            |===========================|
Wave 7 (Emerging)                                      |=========================>
                              Wk 1    Wk 6    Wk 12   Wk 18   Wk 24   Wk 30+
```

**Critical path**: Wave 3A (GPU isolation) must land before Waves 5 and 7A (heavy AI features).

**Parallel tracks**:
- Wave 1 + Wave 2 can run simultaneously (different developers or even same developer — no conflicts)
- Wave 3A + Wave 3B are independent
- Wave 4 can start as soon as Wave 1 is done (shares no code)
- Wave 6 features are independent of each other (can be cherry-picked)

## Research & Strategic Gaps (Auto-Generated Analysis)

**Auditor**: Principal Systems Architect analysis
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Baseline**: v1.14.0 (1,088 routes, 408 core modules, 83 blueprints, 87 test files, 6,925 tests)
**Method**: Full codebase scan, security audit, architecture bottleneck analysis, test/CI pipeline review

> **Context**: This roadmap was authored at v1.9.26 (254 routes, 68 modules). The codebase has since grown **4.3x in routes** and **6x in modules**. The Wave 1-7 structure and growth projections are now obsolete — the "After Wave 7" target of ~393 routes was surpassed at v1.10.5. This analysis identifies the gaps that the rapid feature expansion has opened.

---

### HIGH Priority — Blocking Issues

- **GPU process isolation is still unimplemented (Wave 3A).** This was marked P0 and remains the single most critical infrastructure gap. `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS = 10` in `opencut/jobs.py:42` allows 10 simultaneous ML model loads into VRAM. PyTorch models (Demucs, Real-ESRGAN, InsightFace, SAM2, CLIP, etc.) each consume 500MB-4GB VRAM. Concurrent loads **will** OOM on consumer GPUs. No memory reservation, no model-aware scheduling, no graceful degradation path exists. **Every AI feature added since v1.10 has widened this gap.** The 408-module codebase now has 40+ modules that load GPU models — 6x more than when Wave 3A was planned.
  - *Recommended action*: Implement a GPU memory budget system immediately. At minimum: reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` to 3 for GPU-tagged routes, add a `@gpu_exclusive` decorator that serializes GPU model access behind a semaphore, and report VRAM usage in `/system/status`.

- **Rate limiting covers 4% of async routes.** Security audit found 597 async route handlers but only 23 rate-limit calls. The `require_rate_limit()` decorator exists and works, but was only applied to model-install and a handful of AI routes. All 574 unprotected async routes accept concurrent requests limited only by `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=10`. A single client can trivially exhaust all 10 job slots with expensive operations (batch rendering, video processing, ML inference), starving other requests.
  - *Recommended action*: Introduce rate-limit categories (`gpu_heavy`, `cpu_heavy`, `io_bound`, `light`) and apply to all async routes. GPU-heavy operations should share a pool of 2-3 concurrent slots. CPU-heavy should cap at 4-6.

- **Test coverage is broad but shallow.** 87 test files exist with 6,925 test functions, but the architecture audit reveals 97% of the 408 core modules lack dedicated behavioral tests — they're only exercised indirectly through route smoke tests. The smoke tests in `test_route_smoke.py` use broad status code assertions like `assert resp.status_code in (200, 400, 429)` which pass regardless of whether the feature works correctly. CI enforces only 50% line coverage (`--cov-fail-under=50` in `build.yml`), which is insufficient for a codebase of this size and complexity.
  - *Recommended action*: Raise CI coverage threshold to 65% (target 80% over 2 sprints). Add schema validation for route responses (JSON structure, not just "is JSON"). Prioritize integration tests for the 40 GPU-model-loading modules — these are the highest-risk code paths with the least coverage.

- **Roadmap growth projections are 3x out of date.** The "Route Growth Projection" table estimates 393 routes after all 7 waves. Actual count is 1,088 — a 2.8x overshoot. The "Success Metrics" table, "Completed Work" section, and wave feature lists don't reflect v1.10-v1.14 additions (categories 63-77, 155 new core modules, 20 new route blueprints). The roadmap should be rebased to reflect current reality so it can be trusted for planning.
  - *Recommended action*: Rebase all tables to v1.14.0 actuals. Mark Wave 1-2 features that were implemented in v1.10-v1.14 as DONE. Update dependency legend with new module families. Revise success metrics to reflect 1,088-route baseline.

---

### MEDIUM Priority — Technical Debt & Infrastructure

- **`helpers.py` is a god module (350 imports).** Every core module and most route files import from `opencut/helpers.py`. It contains FFmpeg execution, video probing, output path logic, temp file cleanup, package installation, and progress utilities — responsibilities that span 6+ concerns. This makes it a merge conflict magnet, impossible to test in isolation, and a startup bottleneck (every import chain pulls in the entire module).
  - *Recommended action*: Decompose into `helpers/ffmpeg.py`, `helpers/video_probe.py`, `helpers/paths.py`, `helpers/cleanup.py`, `helpers/packages.py`. Re-export from `helpers/__init__.py` for backward compat. Do this incrementally during feature work, not as a dedicated refactor sprint.

- **UXP migration has 5 months remaining.** CEP end-of-life is approximately September 2026. The roadmap states UXP is at ~85% feature parity (Wave 3B). The UXP panel (`extension/com.opencut.uxp/`) has 7 tabs vs. CEP's 8, and the UXP main.js is 1,523 lines vs. CEP's 7,730 — indicating significant feature gaps in the frontend. No UXP-specific tests exist in CI. The CEP panel continues to receive features (v1.14.0 version bumps touch CEP files), violating the roadmap's "freeze CEP feature additions" directive.
  - *Recommended action*: Audit UXP vs. CEP parity at the feature level (not tab level). Add UXP smoke test to CI. Enforce CEP freeze — new frontend features go to UXP only.

- **No type checking in CI.** 523 Python files with no mypy or pyright enforcement. Type errors (None where str expected, dict where dataclass expected, wrong callback signature) are caught at runtime — if at all. The `on_progress` callback pattern is already documented in CLAUDE.md as a gotcha (core modules call with 1 arg, routes define closures with 2 args), which is exactly the class of bug static typing catches.
  - *Recommended action*: Add `mypy --ignore-missing-imports opencut/` to CI. Start with `--no-strict` and fix errors incrementally. Target: 0 type errors in `opencut/core/` within 2 sprints.

- **Untracked subprocesses can orphan on cancel.** The `@async_job` decorator registers the job's main thread for cancellation, and `_register_job_process()` tracks Popen handles. But 158 subprocess calls across core modules call `subprocess.run()` directly — these finish synchronously within the job thread but can't be interrupted mid-execution. If a user cancels a job while FFmpeg is mid-render (a 30-minute operation), the FFmpeg process runs to completion even though the job is marked cancelled. The process exit code is then silently discarded.
  - *Recommended action*: Wrap long-running subprocess calls in a pattern that checks `job_cancelled` flag and sends SIGTERM to the child process. Alternatively, refactor `run_ffmpeg()` in helpers.py to accept a `job_id` parameter and auto-register the Popen for cancellation.

- **No security scanning in CI pipeline.** The `build.yml` workflow runs ruff lint and pytest but has no security tooling: no bandit (Python security linter), no CodeQL (GitHub's code scanning), no dependabot/Snyk (dependency vulnerability scanning), no SBOM generation. For a project that executes FFmpeg subprocesses, runs `pip install` at runtime via `safe_pip_install()`, and loads ML models from external sources, this is a meaningful gap.
  - *Recommended action*: Add `bandit -r opencut/ -ll` to CI (catches high-confidence security issues). Enable GitHub Dependabot for dependency alerts (zero-effort, just add `dependabot.yml`). Add CodeQL for deeper analysis.

- **Temp file accumulation under load.** 93 modules create temp files via `tempfile.mkstemp()` or `NamedTemporaryFile()`. The deferred cleanup mechanism (`_schedule_temp_cleanup()` in helpers.py) uses a 5-second delay with 3 retries. Under concurrent load (10 video processing jobs), this means hundreds of multi-GB temp files (intermediate FFmpeg outputs, extracted frames, model outputs) can accumulate before cleanup fires. No disk quota, no max-temp-size check, no cleanup-on-startup sweep.
  - *Recommended action*: Add a startup sweep of `tempfile.gettempdir()` for stale `opencut_*` temp files. Add a periodic (60s) background cleanup for files older than 10 minutes. Log temp disk usage in `/system/status`.

- **25+ tests use `time.sleep()` creating flaky CI.** Tests in `test_batch_executor.py`, `test_batch_parallel.py`, `test_boolean_coercion.py`, `test_integration_ffmpeg.py`, and `test_preview_realtime.py` contain sleeps ranging from 10ms to 500ms. These are timing-dependent and will intermittently fail on slow CI runners, Windows VMs, or under load. Additionally, `test_solver_agent.py` uses `random.seed(42)` but other tests don't seed, introducing non-determinism.
  - *Recommended action*: Replace `time.sleep()` in tests with event-based synchronization (threading.Event, condition variables). For async result tests, poll with timeout rather than fixed sleep. Audit and seed all random usage.

---

### LOW Priority — Future Investment

- **No auto-generated API documentation.** With 1,088 routes across 83 blueprints, there is no OpenAPI/Swagger spec, no auto-generated endpoint catalog, and no machine-readable API schema. Plugin developers and external integrators must read route source code. The roadmap's Wave 3C notes FastAPI migration (which brings auto-generated OpenAPI) but defers it. The original trigger — "if >300 routes" — was passed long ago.
  - *Recommended action*: Generate an OpenAPI spec from Flask routes using `flask-smorest` or `apispec` without migrating to FastAPI. Serve Swagger UI at `/api/docs` for development mode only. This is a 1-day effort that unlocks plugin ecosystem development.

- **Blueprint registration is sequential and eager.** `register_blueprints()` in `routes/__init__.py` performs 83 sequential `import` statements at app startup. Each import may trigger module-level initialization (cache setup, constant computation, availability checks). Measured impact is 2-5 seconds on startup — not a production issue but noticeable during development when the server auto-restarts on file changes.
  - *Recommended action*: No immediate action needed. If dev-cycle time becomes a complaint, implement lazy blueprint registration (register on first request to URL prefix).

- **No performance regression detection.** No benchmarks, no load tests, no response-time tracking in CI. With 1,088 routes and 408 modules, a single change to `helpers.py` or `jobs.py` could degrade performance across hundreds of endpoints with no visibility.
  - *Recommended action*: Add a simple benchmark suite (10 representative endpoints, measure p50/p95 response time) that runs in CI and fails on >20% regression. Use `pytest-benchmark` or custom timing.

- **Missing production governance files.** No `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability disclosure process), no `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, no `CONTRIBUTING.md` with architecture guide, no SBOM (software bill of materials). For an open-source project with 408 modules and ML model downloads, these are expected by enterprise adopters.
  - *Recommended action*: Add `SECURITY.md` with disclosure process and supported-versions table. Generate SBOM from `pyproject.toml` deps.

- **FastAPI migration trigger has been reached.** The roadmap defers FastAPI migration until ">300 routes" with the rationale that validation boilerplate would become unmanageable. Current state: 1,088 routes, 879 mutation endpoints, manual `safe_float()`/`safe_int()`/`safe_bool()` validation in every handler. Pydantic models would eliminate ~60% of per-route validation boilerplate and provide automatic request/response schema generation.
  - *Recommended action*: This remains low priority because Flask works and migration risk is high with 83 blueprints. However, the original deferral rationale no longer holds. If a major refactor is planned (e.g., helpers.py decomposition), consider migrating 1-2 blueprints to FastAPI as a proof-of-concept to measure the cost/benefit.
